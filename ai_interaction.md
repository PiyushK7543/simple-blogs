## ‚ùì What does this error mean?  
`ERROR: 42501: must be owner of table users`

**Answer:**

This error means that your database role **does not have permission** to change the `users` table ‚Äî you're **not the owner** of it.

### Why?
- In Supabase, the `auth.users` table is managed internally.
- Only the system (or owner) can alter it.

### Fix:
- **Do not run:** `alter table auth.users ...`
- You can safely remove or comment out that line from your SQL.
